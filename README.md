# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a Turing-complete
simulation game, with a constant space.

When you execute the built program, skip to the next iteration of the game by
pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The program will halt after two consecutive identical
configurations. Otherwise, it can be terminated using<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
<kbd>C</kbd>.
